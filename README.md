# AI-Driven Railway Surveillance System

The AI-Driven Railway Surveillance System aims to leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to enhance crowd management, crime prevention, work monitoring, and cleanliness in Indian Railways. This project proposes integrating AI algorithms into the existing CCTV network to provide real-time insights and proactive solutions for various challenges faced in railway operations.

## Features

1. **Real-time Crowd Management**: Utilizes AI algorithms to monitor crowd density and motion patterns, enabling accurate resource allocation and timely interventions during overcrowding.

2. **Crime Prevention and Detection**: Incorporates facial recognition using deep learning models to identify criminals from existing records, providing alerts to security personnel for proactive risk mitigation.

3. **Cleanliness Monitoring**: Actively identifies instances of littering and vandalism, sending real-time alerts to authorities for maintaining a clean and hygienic environment within railway premises.

4. **Work Monitoring**: Tracks crew activities such as maintenance and production work to ensure adherence to safety protocols and improve overall efficiency of railway operations.

5. **Location-based Insights**: Enriches the system's capability by incorporating location information to map incidents appropriately, empowering railway authorities to address areas requiring immediate attention.

## Solution Architecture

- Initial processing involves frame extraction, size reduction, and noise removal using Gaussian filtering.
- Utilizes a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for detecting areas with high motion intensity and categorizing behaviors.
- R-CNN is employed for facial recognition to detect security threats and unusual behaviors.

## Privacy and Ethical Considerations

- Strong emphasis on passenger privacy and ethical surveillance practices.
- Focus on preventing crime before it happens and crowd management with crowd prediction features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Flask (for web interface, if applicable)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess CCTV footage for analysis.
2. **Model Training**: Train AI models for crowd management, crime detection, cleanliness monitoring, and work tracking.
3. **Integration**: Integrate trained models into the existing railway surveillance infrastructure.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the system for real-time monitoring and analysis.
